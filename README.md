# Upfront-Pricing-Analysis
Upfront pricing allows riders to know the estimated cost of a ride before booking. However, variations in actual ride metrics (distance, time, or route changes) can lead to significant deviations.  This report investigates these discrepancies using provided ride data, identifies underlying causes, and suggests some improvements to minimize price.
